## About

A rudimentary Newtonian gravity simulator. Allows the user to create a system
of particles which are attracted to each other using [Newton's law of universal
gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation#Modern_form).

## Controls:

`click` - create a particle.

`click + drag` - create a particle with initial velocity.

`shift + drag` - pan the camera.

`up arrow` - double the current mass.

`down arrow` - halve the current mass.

`left arrow` - increase the gravitational constant.

`right arrow` - decrease the gravitational constant.

`f` - focus the viewport on the most massive particle. This particle will have
its velocity forced to zero to make the velocities of other particles relative
to it.

`v` - draw helper lines on all particles showing their velocity.
